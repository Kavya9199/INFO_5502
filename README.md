# Risk Factor Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease using machine learning Algorithms

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing medical problem that impairs renal function and ultimately harms the kidneys. Cardiovascular infection and end-stage renal disease are two potentially fatal conditions resulting from CKD, which is currently fairly common. These might be avoided by identifying conditions early and treating those who are in danger. The responsibility of anticipating medical issues is exceedingly challenging. One of the most fatal diseases in the medical world is CKD. The prediction of risk factors is a crucial step in the initial stage before it is too late to identify CKD and eliminate risks. In this study, five algorithms are employed to predict the risk factors of CKD, including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Simple Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Linear Regression Model. Five algorithms provide better and faster characterization execution when taking into account the ordered execution and investigations of these methods. The dataset is run through five different algorithms, and the classification of potential risk factors yields the best results.
